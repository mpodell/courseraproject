Place the run_analysis.R file in the 1st level of extracted data directory i.e. folder containing train and test folders.
Run the R script from R studio
The script produces file tidydataset.txt in the same directory

The data used in the project is data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.The data is divided into train data and test data which were further divided into x,y and subject variables.

Following works were performed on the dataset
1.Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Using descriptive names for each variable
4.Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5.Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
